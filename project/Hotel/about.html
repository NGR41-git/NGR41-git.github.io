                    Nowruz 1401 on the roof of the beautiful city of Tabriz. The main

                    One of the most beautiful and best hotels in Iran. Very polite and
                    personable staff. Excellent and varied breakfast. The driver of the
                    agency, Mr. Mohammadi, is very fair and polite. Very fast acceptance.
                    Cleanliness of the hotel and rooms. Whatever I say about the beauty
                    and cleanliness of the hotel as well as the high character of the
                    staff of this hotel, I have not said enough. The price was also very
                    reasonable. The facilities inside the rooms were perfect
